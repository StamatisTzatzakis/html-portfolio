<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am too old and too tired to learn new things, however a small voice inside my head tells me to do so.
  Keep going it says, so i keep going
</p>

<p>I wanted to become a famous comic book artist, instead i studied economics and became a software tester. No idea how life managed it to get me there, 
  but anyway this is life</p>

<p>Right now i try to learn programming, most probably will manage it if my kids give me some time.</p>
